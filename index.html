  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Basketball simulation games aim to replicate the speed, strategy, and realism of professional basketball.
      Among these, NBA 2K20 stands out as a turning point in how sports simulations balance realism,
      player control, and immersive presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Released as part of the long-running NBA 2K franchise, NBA 2K20 refined many systems that
      shaped modern basketball games and influenced later sports titles across the genre.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Evolution of Basketball Simulation Before NBA 2K20</h2>
    <p>
      Before NBA 2K20, basketball games already featured licensed teams, recognizable player models,
      and basic physics-based movement. However, many earlier versions relied on animation-driven
      gameplay that sometimes felt disconnected from real basketball decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      NBA 2K20 aimed to narrow this gap by emphasizing timing, positioning, and player awareness,
      creating a more authentic simulation experience.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Gameplay Mechanics That Redefined Realism</h2>

    <h3>Skill-Based Shooting System</h3>
    <p>
      One of NBA 2K20’s biggest contributions was its refined shooting system.
      Shot success depended more on timing, player attributes, and defensive pressure,
      reducing reliance on repetitive exploits.
    </p>

    <h3>Improved Player Movement</h3>
    <p>
      Motion transitions became smoother and more responsive. Players no longer snapped
      unnaturally between animations, making on-court movement feel grounded and realistic.
    </p>

    <h3>Defensive Intelligence</h3>
    <p>
      Defensive AI improvements rewarded proper positioning and anticipation rather than
      button-spamming, encouraging smarter basketball strategies.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Impact on Career-Based Sports Modes</h2>
    <p>
      NBA 2K20 expanded the concept of career progression by blending narrative elements
      with performance-based growth. The MyCareer mode emphasized player choices,
      training, and long-term development.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach influenced how later sports games structured career modes,
      focusing on immersion rather than linear progression.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Presentation and Broadcast Authenticity</h2>
    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Visual Fidelity</h3>
        <p>
          Enhanced lighting, facial animations, and crowd behavior contributed
          to a broadcast-quality experience.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Dynamic Commentary</h3>
        <p>
          Commentary reacted more naturally to gameplay events, player performance,
          and game momentum.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Authentic Arenas</h3>
        <p>
          Each NBA arena featured unique sound design and atmosphere,
          reinforcing immersion.

    <h2>Influence on Future Sports Games</h2>
    <p>
      NBA 2K20’s focus on realism influenced not only later NBA 2K releases but
      also other sports simulation franchises. Developers increasingly adopted
      physics-based systems, smarter AI, and deeper career modes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game demonstrated that players value authenticity and strategic depth
      over simplified arcade mechanics.
